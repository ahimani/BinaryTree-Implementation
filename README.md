# BinaryTree-Implementation

This project is the non-recursive implementation of BST (Binary Search tree). For the input, there is a list of strings that will be stored in this BST.

## Other Classes Used: -
For non-recursive BST, 2 classes i.e. Stack and Link List are also created (in-built classes are not used). 

### Functions for stack: -
Push, Pop, PopBottom, peek, peek_bottom elements, check if the stack is empty or not.

## Features of BST: -
Current features include finding height and size of the tree, adding or removing element, checking if the element is present in the tree or not.

Also the data can be printed in either preorder, postorder and inorder printing.

Destructor is also implemented using a stack to deal with memory leaks.
